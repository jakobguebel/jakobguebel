## About Me
I am a Data Scientist with a background in Biology and an ethusiasm for coding that is almost weirding me out. I love data, too, and I track many things in my life. 

**Current projects include**
- Life Analysis: an overview and visualization over my daily and longterm metrics, from spendings to daily state of mind
- Portfolio Manager: a harmonization and visual overview of the performance of assets of all kind, such as etfs, stocks and crypto
- Travel Risk Map: a visual overview over travel risk in countries and cities all around the world, derived from different data sets
- Build you Algotrading-Bot: a dashboard to play around with algotrading
- What Does Google Know About You: an easy way to find out what our favourite search engine knows about you
